This project was created along to a tutorial from MayanWolfe.
What I learned?
  1.) More practice appending to the DOM (option tags to a select tag)
  2.) Working with fetch syntax, grabbing an object and specific items like array elements and images and appending those to the DOM
  3.) Using Object.keys to create an array of the dog breeds out of the object.
  4.) Using the change event in an Event Listener to trigger actions
  5.) Created an object full of properties and methods, accessed those
  5.) Practiced more HTML and CSS
